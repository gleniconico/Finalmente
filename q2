A.  Explain what recursion is and when it is useful.
    Explain what the |termination step| and |recursion step| are in a recursive method.
*
Recursion is a function that will keep looping until it reaches the termination step.
Termination step is when that the function stop looping in certain conditions.
*
B.  Describe the difference between a Queue and a Stack.
*
Stack is defined as a list of element.
Queue is a collection of the same type of element.
*
C.  Write a class for an element of a doublely-linked list.
*
public class DLnkList{
  private DLnk head = new DLnk();
    public int length = 0;
    
    public DLnkList(){}
        public void addDLnk(DLnk newlink){
            newlink.setNext(this.head);
            this.head.setPrev(newlink);
            this.head=newlink;
            length=length + 1;}
                
    public DLnk getiLnk(int i){
        DLnk it = this.head;
        while(i>0){
        it=it.getNext();
        i=i-1;}
        return it;}
                  
    public void removeHead(){
        this.head=this.head.getNext();
        this.head.setPrev(null);
        length = length -1;}
                  
    public DLnk getHead(){
        return this.head;}
                   
}

D.  Explain what a Merkle Tree is.  
    Describe the structure and purpose of a Merkle Tree.
    What is the Merkle root?
    What is the function of a certificate in this data structure?
*
Merkle tree is a tree in which every non-leaf node is labelled with the hash of the labels 
or values (in case of leaves) of its child nodes.

The merkel tree got children, roots and other essential elements. 
Assume that 10 objects need to be organized. First, we take the hash code of all. Then, we combine the 
first 5 and the last 5. Afterwards, we combine the hash that we get from the combination. This can end up getting a 
hash code that includes everything.

Merkle root is an element that exists at the top of the tree.

The function of a certificate is binary system.
